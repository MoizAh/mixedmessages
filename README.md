# Mixed Messages
## Codecademy Project

## Introduction
This project produces a mixed message each time it is run. The message that it outputs is made up of three difference pieces of data.

## Technologies
Project is created using:
* Javascript
* Node (to run the program)

## Setup
To run this program, download the repository:
```
$ cd ../mixedmessages
$ node script.js
```

## Notes
I like One Piece so I used that as my inspiration for the mixed message that is generated.
